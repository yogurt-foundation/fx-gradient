> A complete set of CSS gradient utility for web UI, (FX, aka `Special Effect`).

> Work in progress

Yogurt `{FX}.gradient` started out as a small side-project of mine. As I was increasingly using CSS animations and filters, I thought it would come in handy to have them organized in a meaningful and accessible way so that they can be easily reused on different projects.

I have been using `{FX}.gradient` for a while now and I hope some of you will find it useful as well. It is still very much a work in progress and hopefully it will evolve over the time.

Below are my special collection of css gradient over the years of making web design.
